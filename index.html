          Let’s have a small conversation, wouldn’t I be wrong if I said that
          the first car in your house was from a brand called Suzuki and that we
          as children’s use to watch an assumed raccoon and Chinese called
          Doraemon and Shin-Chan and played with spinners called Beyblade and a
          watch with colourful background light was your Casio g- shock. And if
          I were to ask you what these all these things have in common, after
          some guess you will say they all are the lineage of Japan and that is
          your today’s consumable content.

          This blog is not about telling you how innovative and forward looking
          is Japan and how they are just living a millennium years ahead of
          us(these are just cheesy thumbnail titles your favourite YouTube
          scientist create for you to clickbait). This is more about how this
          island nation which is just bit larger than the state of Rajasthan is
          one of the most innovative and the UPCOMING CULTURAL POWEHOUSE of this
          era.(Also by these inventions Japan has been able to left an
          impression of there culture in people’s mind).

      <h3 class="t-heading">A RECAP OF HISTORY</h3>
      <div class="section-2 section-text">
        <p>
          To begin Japan in much of it’s history didn’t had much influence
          outside it’s mainland and some surrounding island and this was the
          time when dynasties or I say powerful dynasties like Song and Han
          dynasties of China, Gupta and Chola empire of India and Persian empire
          of Iran were emerging as a new powerhouse of Asia and by the term
          powerhouse it doesn't mean just that they were just simple large
          kingdoms but these kingdoms had the power and influence in their
          regions so much that they lead to significant cultural change in their
          surrounding area which has an impression visible till now. For eg-
          ethnic name of Chinese people is Han Chinese named after their famous
          dynasty Han, cultural influence of Chola empire is still visible in
          great parts of Asia stretching from Tamil Nadu all the way to
          Cambodia. Now at that time Japan didn’t got in any sphere of influence
          of any of such powerhouses which only gave it the advantage of
          maintaining its own unique culture, the reason being it’s geographical
          isolation from the rest of Asia. This isolation only helped Japan by
          not making it the direct victims of its nearby dynasties and
          colonizers but this also stopped Japan from entering world geopolitics
          for a good amount of time.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          For this thing to understand let’s just first understand the geography
          of Japan, because it becomes the reason behind your countries success
          and downfall ( and it is a saying in most cases
          <b>GEOGRAPHY IS A WONDERFUL CLUSTERFUL BITCH</b> that has no mercy for
          you).

        <p>
          Now I don't want you to consider geography always an enemy, it has
          it's own pros but for poor Japan it remained a hinderance in much of
          it's history(just see it by yourself).

        <p>
          Japan was blessed with the charishma of geography in such a way that
          it covered about 80 percent of Japan’s land area with mountain which
          automatically made it hard for it’s civilization to foster in larger
          area and as a result of this most of their population had to reside in
          smaller plain areas of Tokyo and Osaka. To make it worse Japan is
          located on the firewall of earth’s tectonic plates meaning major
          development could be done with huge cost and no major cost cutting due
          to high tectonic activities which can lead to earthquakes and
          tusnamies. And Japan was also blessed by mother nature that it is a
          country highly deprived of essential natural resources except for some
          timber and low quality iron ore found in some pocket areas making them
          completely rely on their foreign partners atleast for their basic
          requirement. This lack of resources was one of the reasons that kept
          filthy European colonizers away from Japan, simply because there was
          nothing for them in Japan except from those rigid old and crooked
          samurai’s. (And you know your country is a doom when papa Britain
          doesn’t want to give you a visit).

        DOG DAYS, COLONIAL TIMES AND GLOBAL DOMINATION : A BEGINING OF AND NEW
        ERA
      </h3>
      <div class="section-3 section-text">
        <p>
          Japan dog days got over once when it got united in 1868 into the
          Japanese empire from then on it emerged as a giant in the Asia and it
          was in the time when much of Asia was under European colonialism.
          Japan also became the only Asian colonial empire and was the first
          Asian country to defeat a European country. Now every good times ends
          with some disaster and in Japan case it was two good blast (HIROSHIMA
          AND NAGASAKI) that left it shattered for the centuries to come.
          Interestingly, it was after this period that Japan’s second phase for
          another global dominance began. Global dominance doesn’t always means
          strength in terms of military, strength and resources. It can also be
          in terms of culture which Japan saw once it came under the democratic
          umbrella of Usa. (This will be the later topic of the blog).
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          To explain it more precisely Japan after it was fed with the democracy
          spoon of Usa had brought major changes to it’s old regime. Traditional
          culture was getting replaced with American, Christianity got a major
          paved way to Japan, pop culture was becoming the new anthem of Japan .
          Japan in very way was seen to be the next South Korea who in its will
          would have nothing more than being the second best copy of America
          (cheap one with eyes not found error |: ).

          Japan had lost a chunk of it's territories after ww2 and it also lead
          to loss of culture and influence of Japan in the region and Japan now
          could not loose it's hand on its cultures and roots because loosing it
          mean that Japan no longer will have it's own identity and a country
          which goes under identity crises cannot survive for a long time. This
          was the case with Austria during ww2 when their people felt more close
          to Germans and their culture and were happy when they were annexed
          into Germany. This same loss of culture is seen in South Korea where
          there new generation is not strongly connected to it's own culture and
          well you only differentiate them from other south east Asian based on
          their some cuisines and well that too only when you have some
          knowledge of that. Now the upcoming decades after ww2 when Japan was
          noticing heavy western influence, in such times their local industries
          and custom old tradition of cartoon making helped them in not just
          reviving their culture but also helped it to be seen around the world(
          which you can kind of call it as a export but of culture). Japan's
          traditional form of cartoon making got a boom when it was visualised
          in television, these cartoons more or less showed what Japanese
          culture was and what an ordinary mundane life of Japan's people was
          which also showed th degree of westernization it had and the
          traditional ethics which their people still tie till date in order to
          preserve their culture.
